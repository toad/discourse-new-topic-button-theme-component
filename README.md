# Discourse New Topic button theme component (with two buttons!)

This is a fork of the official "New Topic" button component:
- https://meta.discourse.org/t/new-topic-button-on-all-pages-theme-component/84551

It adds a New Topic button at both the top and bottom of a post. This is 
helpful because it reminds people considering replying to a post that they
might want to make a new one instead. The default category is already filled 
in (upstream has a bug breaking this). 

Also, it does not hide the standard New Topic button on topic lists, unlike 
upstream (which puts its own button **everywhere**!).

It is possible that changes to the upstream version will eventually make this 
fork obsolete.

This was inspired by this previous fork:
